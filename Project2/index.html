          <h2 class="section-header">About Given Domains</h2>
          <li>Front End Development</li>
          <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

               The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant.
               This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site.
               They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
          <li>Backend Development</li>
          <p>The backend of a website is a combination of servers, applications, and databases.
               Code written by backend developers helps browsers in communicating with the databases and store data into the database, read data from the database, update the data and delete the data or information from the database.</p>
               <li>Machine Learning</li>
               <p>Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.</p>
               <li>Ethical Hacking</li>
               <p>Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.</p>
               <li>Cyber Security</li>
               <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, devices and data from damage, loss or unauthorized access. Just as physical security protects buildings and the people in them from various physical threats, cybersecurity safeguards digital technologies and their users from digital dangers</p>
               <li>Data Science</li>
               <p>Data Science is the area of study that involves extracting insights from vast amounts of data by using various scientific methods, algorithms, and processes. Statistics, Visualization, Deep Learning, Machine Learning are important Data Science concepts.</p>
               <li>Javascript</li>
               <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
